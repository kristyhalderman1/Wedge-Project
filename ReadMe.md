The Wedge Community Co-Op is a natural foods grocery store located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the largest co-operative grocery store in the US.  During the course of the semester, our cohort had the opportunity to work with Wedge customer transaction data as a means to improve our analytical skillset and develop better business acumen.  This project is a culmination of those skills, where we break down what we have learned into various tasks. 

- In Task One, we uploaded transaction records to GBQ from Python (I worked with clean files).  

- In Task Two, we separate owners from non-owners (everyone is welcome at the Wedge!) and take a sample from a list of those owners since this will make it easier to analyze.  

- Finally, for Task Three, we put those analytical skills to the test by building a SQLite database via Python which will contain three tables further diving into transactional data by examining sales by date by hour, sales by owner by year by month, and sales by product description by year by month. 



### Task 1: Upload the Files 

Created a path to source the cleaned files (re: clean_files) and assigned to object 'clean_wedge_files,' then uploaded all the data into GBQ data set appropriately named 'wedge.' 


`File1 Name`: 
Description of what this file does.

<!--  Repeat for each file  --> 



### Task 2: Sample of Owners 

* Files for this task: 
<!--  List of file or files here  --> 

Loads all data into GBQ data set.

`File1 Name`: 
Description of what this file does.

<!--  Repeat for each file  --> 
	

### Task 3: Building Summary Tables 

* Files for this task: 
<!--  List of file or files here  --> 

Loads all data into GBQ data set.

`File1 Name`: 
Description of what this file does.

<!--  Repeat for each file  --> 


## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - john_results)/john_results)`. 



|  Query  |  Your Results  |  John's Results | Difference | Rel. Diff | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total Rows  |   |   |   |   |
| January 2012 Rows  |   |   |   |   |
| October 2012 Rows  |   |   |   |   |
| Month with Fewest  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows in Month with Fewest  |   |   |   |   |
| Month with Most  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows in Month with Most  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_TS  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_DT  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_Local  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_CN  |   |   |   |   |
| Num 5 on High Volume Cards  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
|  Num Rows for Number 5 |   |   |   |   |
| Num Rows for 18736  |   |   |   |   |
| Product with Most Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows for that Product  |   |   |   |   |
| Product with Fourth-Most Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows for that Product  |   |   |   |   |
| Num Single Record Products  |   |   |   |   |
| Year with Highest Portion of Owner Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA |
| Fraction of Rows from Owners in that Year  |   |   |   |   |
| Year with Lowest Portion of Owner Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA |
| Fraction of Rows from Owners in that Year  |   |   |   |   |
